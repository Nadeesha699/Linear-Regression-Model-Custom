# Linear-Regression-Model-Custom

Linear Regression is a foundational technique in machine learning, and our Python implementation demonstrates its application using a CSV dataset. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you'll gain hands-on experience in training and evaluating a Linear Regression model. This knowledge can be applied to various domains, such as finance, economics, and natural sciences, where understanding relationships between variables is crucial for making predictions and informed decisions. Let's dive in and explore the world of Linear Regression in Python! Speacially Bit It is custom :)
